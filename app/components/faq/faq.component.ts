		<h2>What is Chilesoup</h2>
		<p>The motivation to start chilesoup came from a difficulty of finding 
		fellow musicians who were interested in playing in a casual jam 
		session once a week. People on CraigsList tended to be very serious 
		about music or even professionals looking to make money from playing 
		gigs asap. On the other end of the spectrum, friends and contacts 
		in university who played instruments would initially be excited 
		by the idea, but would drop out once midterms and finals came 
		around. With chilesoup, we were looking to bring together people 
		who want to play music, but who do not necessarily want to commit 
		to playing shows, recording albums or touring.
