People on CraigsList tended to be very serious \n\t\tabout music or even professionals looking to make money from playing \n\t\tgigs asap. On the other end of the spectrum, friends and contacts \n\t\tin university who played instruments would initially be excited \n\t\tby the idea, but would drop out once midterms and finals came \n\t\taround. With chilesoup, we were looking to bring together people \n\t\twho want to play music, but who do not necessarily want to commit \n\t\tto playing shows, recording albums or touring.\n\t\t</p>\n\t"
